    <p>Hi, my name is Bretzel! I'm someone with a hefty interest in coding, but I don't really have any of the motivation to to do anything with it. This lil' project is an attempt to fix that, and do something slightly productive with the abundance of free time that I have. It may not get the most frequent updates or content, but it'll be something!</p>
